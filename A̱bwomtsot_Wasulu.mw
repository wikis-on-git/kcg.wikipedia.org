Wassoulou music is performed mostly by women. Some recurring themes in the lyrics are [[childbearing]], [[fertility]], and [[polygamy]]. Instrumentation includes [[soku]] (a traditional [[fiddle]] sometimes replaced with modern imported instruments), [[djembe]] drum, [[Ngoni (instrument)|kamalen n'goni]] (a six-stringed [[harp]]), karinyan (metal tube percussion) and [[Bolon (musical_instrument)|bolon]] (a four-stringed [[harp]]). The vocals are often passionate and emphatic, and delivered in a [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] pattern.
