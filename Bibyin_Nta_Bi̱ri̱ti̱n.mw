(di̱n Shong). UK Government (6 Zwat Swak 2014). "There are 14 Overseas Territories which retain a constitutional link with the UK. .... Most of the Territories are largely self-governing, each with its own constitution and its own government, which enacts local laws. Although the relationship is rooted in four centuries of shared history, the UK government's relationship with its Territories today is a modern one, based on mutual benefits and responsibilities. The foundations of this relationship are partnership, shared values and the right of the people of each territory to choose to freely choose whether to remain a British Overseas Territory or to seek an alternative future."</ref><ref>[https://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/british-overseas-territories-law-9781509918713/ British Overseas Territories Law] (di̱n Shong).
