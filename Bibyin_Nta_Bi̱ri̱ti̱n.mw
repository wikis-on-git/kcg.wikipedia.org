(di̱n Shong). UK Government (6 Zwat Swak 2014). "There are 14 Overseas Territories which retain a constitutional link with the UK. .... Most of the Territories are largely self-governing, each with its own constitution and its own government, which enacts local laws. Although the relationship is rooted in four centuries of shared history, the UK government's relationship with its Territories today is a modern one, based on mutual benefits and responsibilities. The foundations of this relationship are partnership, shared values and the right of the people of each territory to choose to freely choose whether to remain a British Overseas Territory or to seek an alternative future."</ref><ref>[https://www.bloomsburyprofessional.com/uk/british-overseas-territories-law-9781509918713/ British Overseas Territories Law] (di̱n Shong).

"''Most, if not all, of these territories are likely to remain British for the foreseeable future, and many have agreed modern constitutional arrangements with the British Government.''"</ref> Huhwa si̱ yet nkap A̱byintyokshan Bi̱ri̱ti̱n ngaan na na̱ bwat a̱ni a̱wot si̱ nwai yet kap Muna̱pyia̱ A̱byintyok hu ma̱ng a̱pyia̱ nhu.
